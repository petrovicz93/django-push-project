Welcome

{{ first_name }},

Welcome! We'd give you a treat, in real life! And we probably will, when we meet in person. Now on to the exciting part!


** Have you chosen a pricing plan that fits your goals?
------------------------------------------------------------

If yes, we're impressed! You're a decisive person and we love that.

If no, give the FREE Trial a test. You can use all the best features of Push Monkey and send a huge number of notifications for free, for 14 days. No credit cards or other strings attached.


** Why Push Monkey is NOT for everyone?
------------------------------------------------------------

Desktop push notifications are much more intimate than e-mail newsletters and with much higher engagement rates.

If your content is published very often or is spammy, Push Monkey is not for you.

** Rolling out Desktop Push Notifications to your audience
------------------------------------------------------------
Because it's a new way to distribute content, simply launching the service and taking your readers by surprise might not be the best idea. Here are some tips of how to properly let your audience know about Desktop Push Notifications: http://blog.getpushmonkey.com/rolling-push-notifications-audience/?source=welcome_email


** Closing words
------------------------------------------------------------
